      Array registers and the `:` and `;` commands have not yet been
      implemented. They will be added ASAP.
    </li><li>
      The commands `q` and `Q` were not implemented because I did not see
      the usefulness of "quitting" the interpreter in the absence of a shell
      to return control to. However, these commands can be useful in macros so
      I may implement them eventually.
    </li><li>
      The original dc provides arbitrary-precision arithmetic. This
      implementation currently relies on JavaScript's fixed-precision
      Number primitives for arithmetic. I'd like to fix this at some point,
      but it's not a priority.
    </li><li>
      Commands that interact with the shell such as `!`, `?`, and `e` have not
      and likely will not be implemented.
