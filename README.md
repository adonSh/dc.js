# dc.js

One of the oldest (possibly the oldest) of the original Unix utilities, now in
website form. It's simply a calculator using postfix or reverse-Polish
notation. This implementation is heavily inspired by the OpenBSD source
code but was mostly tested against the GNU version because I don't have an
OpenBSD box, so some inconsistencies do exist and few extensions from either
version have been implemented.
