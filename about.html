    One of the oldest (possibly the oldest) of the original Unix utilities, now
    in website form. It's simply a calculator using postfix or reverse-Polish
    notation. This implementation is heavily inspired by the OpenBSD source
    code but was mostly tested against the GNU version because I don't have an
    OpenBSD box, so some inconsistencies do exist and few extensions from either
    version have been implemented.
